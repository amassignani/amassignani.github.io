    <h1>Search Inside Myself</h1>

    <h2>The capacity to be aware of, control, and express one's emotions,
      <br> and to handle interpersonal relationships judiciously and empathetically.</h2>


    <p>How did I find the two minutes of mindfulness</p>

    <h3>Focus on an aspect of my breathing, such as the sensations of air flowing into my nostrils<br>and out of my mouth, or my belly rising and falling as I inhale and exhale.</h3>
