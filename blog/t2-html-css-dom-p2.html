    <h1>Html, CSS & Dom.</h1>

    <h3>How the websites works?</h3>
    <p>
     If I have to explain to my non-technical friend, I will start to compering the Html,CSS and doc as my house...
    </p>

    <h3>Html is like the structure of my house:</h3>
    <p>
      Where the walls is place, what room  is my living-room, kitchen, bathroom.
    </p>

    <h3>CSS is the style:</h3>
    <p>
      What color of the walls and the decorations I want to place.
    </p>
    <h3>Dom is the tools</h3>
    <p>
      How could you put all this toguether whitout tools,rigth?
    </p>
    <h3>What is meant by boxifying design and box model?</h3>
    <p>
      Turning every element on my websit as boxes, that way is easy to visualise the areas and work on it. Content, picture, navegation, if you think it a box its easy to work on it.
