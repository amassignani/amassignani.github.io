          <h2> Self Confidence</h2>
          <h4>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</h4>
          <p>Mindfulness is being fully where you already are realizing the power of your full presence and awareness right now.<br>Self-awareness goes beyond insigth into a broader domain of 'self', such as understanding our own strengths and weakness and being able to acess our own inner wisdom.<br> When you stay in a mindfulness mind you are able to self awareness.<br><br>
          Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience ofit? How did you feel?<br>
          I tried 'Boby Scan' and it really help me to focus. I paid more attention to my body needs: go for a walk or straigthing after being sit down for a long time.<br><br>
          What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me"section?<br>
          Our emotions is not define what you are, our existence but what we are feeling at the particular moment in our life.</p>
